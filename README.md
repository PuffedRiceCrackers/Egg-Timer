<h1>Egg Timer</h1>


Click how you'd like your eggs and an alarm will ring just at the right time. For now it will ring at 5 seconds, 7 seconds, 12 seconds because I had to check if it was working but didn't want to wait... ðŸ¤£

Material provided from [AppBrewery](https://www.appbrewery.co/), and all my appreciation goes to the amazing instructor Angela Yu.


## I Learned

I learned some basic swift grammar and XCode interface, but most importantly, how to navigate the internet to find solution that an instructore didn't directly teach.
 
â€¢ Dictionary<br />
â€¢ Time API<br />
â€¢ Do Catch<br />
â€¢ Progressbar<br />
â€¢ XCode is so kind
